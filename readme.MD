esp32-shell
===========

CLI / GUI to control a connected ESP32, running micropython.

The CLI is almost entirely based on mpfshell (see https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell).

Instead of using the regular **cmd** package, **cmd2** is used (see 
https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2).

The GUI is written using PySide2 (similar to PyQT5) and makes use of commands defined in the CLI.
